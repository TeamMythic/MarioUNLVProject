- Package Manager Stuff to Add:
	- Input System:
	- URP if not in current porject: (if people are using built in URP they need to switch):
- PLayer Movement:
(Settp):
Create empty Game Object "Player" - reset transform to 0 on x, y, and zed if not at origin:
	Components: 
		Sprite Renderer, Rigidbody 2D, Box Collider 2D
			- Rigidbody2D: make gravity around 4, constraint on z axis:
	Child Components:

Create Plaeyer Movement Script:

Assign Layer Ground to every platform

Create a PhysicMaterial2D with 0,0 for params and assign to RB

ANIMATING:
	make sure to show the transition from walk to idle to have a fixed duration with a transition on .15
	because you want to have it where if you slightly press the A or D key they play should animate
	and not slide

Tilemapping: 
	To fix small screen tearing in the tile map, make a sprite atlas (2D) and add the spritesheet to it
